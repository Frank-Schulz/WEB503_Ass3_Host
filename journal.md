### Things that I learned
 - How to generate a product page  
 I was able to generate my product page based off the button that was clicked to get there. I did this by linking to the product page and executing a function when the links were clicked that set a variable that controlled which product was displayed.  

 - How to check the window size in javascript  
 When ensuring the website was responsive I ran into an issue where I had to edit text when the window became to small which (to my knowledge) is not possible in CSS.

### Issues / Fixes
 - As mentioned above I had an issue where I had to edit text on the website when the window became too small and had to learn to query the window size in javascript.
 - Wasn't catching an error were a user clicked 'Add to Cart' when not logged in, as the cart is tied to the login.  
 Added a simple 'is logged in' check at the top of 'Add to Cart' functions.

### Descisions
 - I generated the product page to save time in creating the website, this would not be done in the real world.
 - I could have made the 'Buy Now' functionality of products better, but had to comprismised to do time contraints.

### Notes
 - For reasons unknown to me the product images sometimes look very strange but fix themselves on reload.
